# arena350

A website for buying sport event tickets, written in PHP

## Setup


Install XAMPP for the relevant OS per the instructions [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

Open XAMPP and click 'Manage Servers'. Ensure that `MySQL Server` and `Apache Server` are running.

Clone this Github repository in the local folder that the Apache server serves from. On Mac, this will be `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs`.Â 

### Run the migration in MySQL

All SQL statements should be entered through PHPAdmin, which runs through XAMPP at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php?route=/server/sql`.

Create a new database in the XAMPP MySQL local server:

```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `arena350`;
```

After selecting the newly created database via:

```
USE DATABASE `arena350`;
```

Under `arena350/migrations`, copy paste the contents of `db.sql` into  and hit 'Go'.
Do the same with `mockdata.sql` - this will seed the database with mock event and ticket data.

Navigate to the home page by going to `http://localhost/arena350`, this is the login page.
