        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn August 2013, work began on the sandy alluvium foundation for the stadium. Work on the foundation was completed in May 2014. Construction commenced on the stadium substructure in October 2015.<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn December the construction site began to bring in heavy equipment and construction materials. In January 2015, crews began driving piles.
            <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn March 2015, the stadium project was revised, reducing the cost of construction to 3 billion rubles. In the summer of 2015 pile driving was completed and superstructure construction began.</p>
